## Project Brief
Wrangle, analyze and visualize the tweet archive of twitter user @dog_rates, which is also know as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. This project was a part of Udacity's Data Analysis Nanodegree Program.

## Data Sources
> **twitter-archive-enhanced.csv**: Twitter Archive of WeRateDogs which was sent exclusively to Udacity for the students to use in this project.
>
> **image_predictions.tsv**: what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network.
>
> **tweet_json.txt**: meta data for each tweet(retweet count, favourite, etc.). This data was scraped using the tweet ID in the twitter archive and using Python Tweepy's library.
